<p>A little about me:</p>

<p>I have been using a computer for as long as i can remember, I studied systems engineering at a university in my country (career that does not end), but luckily I started working in the technology area. I focused on learning everything about Data Networks, After having met with an old love (linux), I wanted to study it until I reached the level of system administrator, after achieving this small goal, I started with software development.</p>
