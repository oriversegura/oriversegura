# Hi, I'm Oriver! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me

Born in Dominican Republic, I'm 30+ years old, I've always liked everything related to tech, i started studying Systems Engineering but I didn't finish because of life problems, after many years working in network and infrastructure integration, I decided to start my own path, which led me to where I am now, which is driving my own company, and at the same time I'm studying software engineering at UAPA.

At the moment my repositories may not be the most interesting, but with time they will improve.
